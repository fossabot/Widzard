# Widzard

Like [Madge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/madge) but made by an idiot.

I got bored one day and decided I wanted to make a graph from my webpack builds output, this is that, enjoy!

## Set up

### Graphviz
> [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) is currently required, though I'm hoping to change this via the use of [Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre).

### Development
- `npm i` install all the things.
- `npm i -g` to install Widzard globally.
- `widzard -h` to make sure everything is set up correctly.
