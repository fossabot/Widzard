# Widzard

Like Madge but made by an idiot.

I got bored one day and decided I wanted to make a graph out of my webpack builds output, this is that, enjoy!

## Set up

---

- `npm i` install all the things.
- `npm i -g` to install Widzard globally.
- `widzard -h` to make sure everything is set up correctly.
